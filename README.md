# College-Admission-Management-System

Developed Admission management by processing requests within available seats in a requested stream. 
The system simplifies admission requests by validating data, processing applications based on available seats in the 
requested stream, handling exceptions, and generating reports. Integrated Kafka for message-driven architecture and 
Docker for containerization.
